You can verify the fractal size is 2048x2048 by checking the Handler and UI classes. 

Handler sets the _size variable to 2048 and this is then
used in all other classes (eg, ImageFractals and its extensions) to compute the fractal size and associated math (eg, 2D array dimensions).

UI calls setsSize on the fractalPanel and passes through a new Dimension object measuring 2048 by 2048. This ensures the GUI will display
properly when our other classes send through the 2048 by 2048 @D array of escape times.
